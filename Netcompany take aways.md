**Q** What was our job
**A** The project i was working with the aplication hosting the public insuranse of denmark (this application was used by many users, their work was to review calls of citisens and aprove or dissaprove theitr call for compensation related to work accidents). My team was doing maintenance to this application. My job in the team was to solving insidents, an insident was  a call of the client of a potential bug reguarding the corect functionality of the system. In order to solve it i fist was reviewing the extended documentation writen in danish looking to find if the noticed behaivior was expected by the design, in the case the behavior was not expected by the design, then the insident was considered as a bug, in this case i had to change the backend's code or add new codeto it that makes the system function as writen in the documentation. In some instanses i had to also make changes to the documentation as well. 

Aftyer making the change in the code i had to test it that is working, many times in order to do that i had to book one of the test environments and deploy the change there... 

my role has also consulting qualities, many times i had to talk with the client that made the insident to get morte context of the problem.

I also worked a little bit with automated testing also, where we where testing the code after every release, the automated testing code was tuning the UI witch was writen in angular

The technologies i worked with was: GIT, LINQ, SQL, .net, AI (it helped me very much giving me basic explanation to questions i had about the technol9o0gies)


The tools i used was : MSSMS ,Source tree (cloning repos and going back to previus versions of the code, also solving merge conflicts, LINQpaD, Enterprice architect, ), SPLUNK (when an error was acuring to the system i was tracing the logs of the system through splunk in order to find the specific logic in code producing the issue), Developer Tools (many times i had to inspect the elements in the webpage that the ui was presented in order to trace setrain ui elements to the code)
, Azure devops (making PRs and migrations in the db to multiple environments)
say that you had the role of IT consultand, Visual studio, 




**Q** what other technologies and things i worked with
**A**
