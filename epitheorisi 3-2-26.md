# LAST atempt to state my improvements, and get PM to Review

**NIKOS dec3**
Good morning Eleni,

I'm sending you this regarding our performance review. I have something to suggest that will improve the tracking of my progress. During this period, I'm creating a file that contains all the areas of improvement we've discussed, and for each one I've written the actions I'm taking or have taken to reach the expected level, as well as how much I believe I'm aligned with what's expected.

I'm thinking I could give this to you and you could fill in for each one flow much what I believe aligns with your perspective. In cases where for an area of improvement we both agree that it's 100% aligned, it would be considered a pass. In cases where for some area I believe it's aligned, but you believe it's not, you would give me some hints to make it aligned and bring it closer. The percentage of areas of improvement that have become aligned would correspond to the progress I've made and the completion percentage of the process.

This way I won't be anxious, but I'll also have a clearer view of which improvement area I'll work on until the next review. I believe that with this method, the effectiveness of the process will increase.

What do you think?
With regards / Best regards
Nikolaos Sarantopoulos

Hello Nikos,

Please send your file over when you're ready, and I'll be happy to review it.

As we discussed, remember that not all areas for improvement can be measured with numbers.

My goal is to help you refine the document and reduce any stress.

With regards / Best regards

**NIKOS dec9** 
Hello Eleni,

I plan to review all the feedback you have sent me and provide my perspective on how much I believe I have grown over the past six months. If you could take a look and confirm whether you agree with what I have written, I would greatly appreciate it. If you have any objections or see things differently, please feel free to share your view.

The reason I would like to send these emails is that I feel the current review format highlights my shortcomings but does not fully reflect the improvements I have made in the areas you identified. By sharing my progress in this way, I hope we can more accurately track my development over time. If you believe there is a better or more efficient way for me to present my progress, I would be very happy to follow the approach you recommend.

Areas of improvement band 1:

1

Self-Reliance and Problem-Solving

1.1 Review personal notes and available resources before raising repeated questions to colleagues. It's important that you utilize your existing knowledge, skills, and notes before reaching out to peers.

1.2Focus on relevant information only - it's okay to ignore areas of the application that don't impact your current solution.

1.3Be more independent, as team members may not always be immediately available to assist.

PROGRESS:

Over the past period, I have made significant progress in becoming more self-reliant and effective in my problem-solving approach. I began by reorganizing my notes to ensure that information is easy to retrieve, which has helped me apply existing knowledge more efficiently. As my English skills improved, working with detailed documentation-initially a challenge-became much more manageable, allowing me to comfortably rely on documentation and existing resources before approaching colleagues.
I rarely ask repeated or unnecessary questions now, and when I realize that I could have found an answer independently, I quickly correct myself and communicate that I will handle it on my own. I have also adopted the strategy we discussed of focusing only on information that is directly relevant to the task at hand. At the same time, when working on an area where I lack knowledge, I do my own independent research to educate myself. This targeted approach helps me gain deep, task-specific knowledge while gradually building a broader understanding of the overall system.
Over time, this method has enabled me to better connect different parts of the system and form a more complete picture of how everything works. Many things make sense now when I work on cases, which can be seen in the increase in my performance over the past two weeks.
Developing independence has been my biggest priority. To support this, I created a table summarizing key insights and expectations from our meetings, which helped me clarify what was required. Although gaining system-wide knowledge took time, I now feel much more confident and increasingly capable of generating new knowledge by connecting the dots. My meetings with MMJ on communication, together with my mentor's guidance, have helped me ask more effective questions and communicate more clearly. Becoming familiar with the necessary tools has further strengthened my independence.

Overall, I believe I have met the expectations set for me in this area.

2

Communication and Feedback

2.1. Direct questions to one person instead of approaching multiple people with the same question.

2.2. Take feedback more effectively by writing down questions and suggestions, then practicing them.

2.3 Be mindful of language and tone, especially in formal contexts.

2.4 Follow instructions precisely and filter out unnecessary information when receiving help from colleagues

2.5 Provide more accurate time estimates and regular progress updates

PROGRESS:

I have made substantial progress across all areas in this band, particularly in how I communicate, handle feedback, and collaborate with colleagues. I now direct my questions to only one appropriate person and select the right team based on the topic-for example, contacting Team Breve for business-related questions, Team IR for integration matters, a colleague who previously handled a similar task, or the peer who wrote the relevant code. Most importantly, I only reach out after fully exhausting my notes, documentation, and every available resource.

Throughout this review period, I have significantly improved how I capture and apply feedback. I keep my notes continuously updated whenever a colleague explains a business flow, a code flow, or a testing/reproduction method. In parallel, I have been working on asking better, more focused questions. My current problem-solving approach always starts with challenging myself first; only after I have used everything I know do I escalate the question further.

Regarding language and tone, I consistently use spell-checking for my communications with both clients and peers. This improvement is evident in my Toolkit responses and the structured way I now ask questions, following the standards established through my meeting with MMJ.

One area I am still developing is following instructions precisely. Very rarely, I might misunderstand a colleague when instructions are given verbally in English, though this is becoming increasingly uncommon. Other times, the misunderstanding comes from lacking system knowledge-for example, not fully understanding a step like "run the job" because I'm not yet familiar with what the job is, where it is located, or its purpose. In these cases, I ask the colleague for clarification, while also being mindful not to repeat questions unnecessarily. This is an area I continue to work on, and I am confident it will improve with time and deeper system understanding.

Providing accurate time estimates has also been a challenge. In the past, I often delivered later than expected because most technical areas were new to me, requiring extensive research in my notes and documentation before asking even a single clarifying question. I was prioritizing independence to avoid unnecessary questions or relying on peers too much. After guidance from MMJ and my mentor, I am now much closer to finding the right balance between researching independently and asking timely questions. Although I am not fully aligned yet, I am progressing steadily and just need a bit more time to refine this skill.

Overall, I believe i am aligned with almost all areas in this band. The two remaining areas-following instructions precisely and providing underway, and I am confident that with continued practice and experience, I will fully meet expectations soon.

3

Documentation and Knowledge Management

1.Improve notetaking by regularly reviewing, summarizing, and verifying the accuracy of your notes.

2.Research documentation independently before asking questions. Try to use cortex extension in Toolkit to find the relevant one.

3.Avoid blind trust in Al tools - filter responses according to each specific scenario.

About notetaking and using the available resources before asking questions I have answered to the other sections. Reguarding Al, I have now minimize its use only to those scenarios: spellcheck, explain code, translate, make a sum up from splunk logs, in case I don't understand fully a documentation before asking a question I will ask cortext to explain a section of the documentation for me, ill throw in vast result set (go code log) and ill ask it if can find any specific patterns.

I believe I am align with this band of areas of improvement

4

Project Management and Tools

1. Adhere to defined processes when working with cases and any related tasks

2. Become more familiar with project tools (Toolkit, ADO, Splunk, etc.).

3. Follow best practices and formatting conventions

PROGRESS:

In terms of team procedures, most of them were documented, but at the beginning I was not able to fully understand them because I lacked knowledge of some core concepts. Over time, however, I learned best by encountering real scenarios, which helped me connect the documentation to practical situations. At this moment, I feel that I am aligned with all the procedures I am aware of, including the use of Toolkit and Azure DevOps. I believe I use these tools correctly in the context of working with cases, and I would welcome additional responsibilities so I can learn more procedures, as I enjoy the structured nature of how the team operates.

I also want to highlight that I am now familiar with working with Splunk. Overall, I believe I am now comfortable using Toolkit, ADO, and Splunk in my day-to-day work with cases, and I continue to make steady progress, improving a little more each day.

over all i think i am also align with this band too (talking of the scenarios i have worked on until now)

Thank you very much for the time you invest in me, I believe that this investment will pay of soon. Nikos.

Hello Michael,

After discussing my current situation with my mentor regarding the performance reviews, he advised me to request a check-in meeting with you to discuss this matter.

While the first two reviews I had with my TL, ELME, were very constructive and genuinely helped me grow (they really did - see details marked with asterisks in my notes), I felt that the most recent review was largely unfair and punitive in nature.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss:

1. The fact that I am at a point where I feel afraid to ask questions because I fear that ELME or other members of the team will accuse me of not understanding or not receiving feedback well.

2. Some of ELME's guidance appears contradictory.

Example: I'm told to "be more independent" and "don't ask too many questions, but also need to seek help when necessary. : I'm told "You need to

became better, and reach the

expectations" and "don't work

more that 8 hours, consider work balance", "don't ask many questions".

3. The 'independence' soft skill ELME mentioned is vaguely explained. At our last meeting, we related the 'independence' soft skill with another soft skill we referred to as 'Find a way, which ELME said would be explained in the next review without providing guidance on how to acquire it, although I was judged for not having this soft skill in the last review.

4. An opportunity to present the actions I have taken to improve myself in the identified improvement areas.

5. The consistency and fairness of the feedback I'm receiving.

6. A request for clear, measurable goals and expectations moving forward (I don't think the progress I am making right now is being monitored effectively, as the last review didn't show the progress I made in the other improvement areas but instead presented an unfair, punitive, and entirely negative picture. Also, I wanted to mention that up until now, proficiency in ADO & Toolkit had been referred to as a secondary concern, and the documentation I was provided with was a little vague for me since I had zero previous experience. I had already made it known to ELME that the documentation was not fully understandable and that I would follow a hands-on practical approach to learn).

I want you to know that I really like this role and envision myself becoming excellent at this job. My examples are CHTAM & TEB - my goal is to become as skilled as they are so I can help the team effectively. I believe I will start becoming genuinely helpful very soon because I have already developed an understanding of the system, and things have started flowing more naturally.

resorces:

This is my Understanding of what soft skill 'Independance' mean, in order for me to understand it and integrate it


::: IMANGE


-

those are my actions for the next review(160ct)

**GIT**

prepare a doc with git commands:

merge conflict,

clone-create ssh key,

stage(add)-commit-push,

pull

revert code to last commit (in case of loosing my work)

watch pop-up

watch ACADEMY video

**ToolKit:**

??? ask for guidance to reach the Expected

make a filter

make an IT case

watch some pop ups

.....





-this is a suggested structure of our next ELME checkin

1) ask for minutes of meeting-cortex (that will help me to make sure i have undertand correctly what you want from me)

2) discuss the initial idea that we should review all the improvement areas, and give a score to all of them so to see the rate of 'Expected performance' to each improvement goal.

.3) take all one by one the improvement goals, and asc if it was expected this week

4) explain the 'soft skill i lacking, and guidance of how to accoplish it

.5) explain what you think i haven't understand of your previus feedback, and

.6) talk about the fear i have to ask questions or be audit for some things, fearing i will be accused for badUnderstanding, or not goo Feedback.

.7) make again known, that i need to make some mistakes in order to learn, and that all the times i made a mistake that i accused for it was also the last time i did it, i learn from my mistakes and i have NEVER make a the same mistake twice. So i believe that i sould not be panished for doing firstTime mistakes.


last time we had a misunderstanding:

1)i use to set some questions before the meeting. just to make them known, that we will talk about that in the meeting.

2)some time people think that i am pasive aggresive or rude when sending a message.

Something like that is never true, i just some times i prefer to be straight and imidiate so to deliver as more meaning.

3)I felt that the last review was punitive than constructive.

- Request written documentation of expectations and timeline

- Understand consequences if goals aren't met

-Discuss learning timeline for ADO/toolkit mastery

- Negotiate achievable milestones

- What does success look like at the 6-month mark?

- Can you provide specific examples of the ADO/toolkit skills needed?

- What resources are available to help me develop these skills?

best regards

Thanks for everything

(*After almost 2 months in this performance plan, I feel much more productive. It has been a valuable learning experience for me, and I really want to thank you and ELME for your efforts.)

Would you be available for a meeting

this week or next?

Best regards, Nikos


**MMJ**

Hi Nikolaos, I'm sorry to hear you've felt that the discussion has not been constructive lately. I'll book you in for a meeting where we can discuss everything

**NIKOS**

Thank you very much and welcome back.
There is no problem at all
(and also i want to specify that, the discusions i have with Eleni are always very constructive, only the last review email was a little harsh)

**i tryed to raise the isue to my TL** 



NIKOS 3 OCT



Thank you for the feedback, but I disagree. I think it's unfair and doesn't reflect the effort I'm putting in (for example, it doesn't highlight any positives). I also think it deviates quite a bit from what we discussed in the one-to-one call.

However, this kind of feedback is very useful, because it sets the bar high – and that's exactly what I look for in a work environment.

**ELME**

Hello Niko, I don't think it excludes what we discussed, on the contrary I think it clearly reflects where you need to focus your attention. In any case, we can discuss it again next time if you don't agree.

October 6 09:54

I have leave on October 27th.


**nikos**


I agree that the feedback makes it very clear what I need to pay attention to in the coming weeks.

However, I would like to record the actions I take to align with all areas of improvement (e.g. the % completion rate for each area), so that the effort I make is also captured.

If you want, I can myself collect the actions I have taken in each area:

Examples:

Toolkit: Before I left for CES, I turned to status 12 cases and assigned test responsibles to status 35 cases so that they could be released.

ADO: I did 2 correct PRS and a Patcher. I also solved 2 times
merge conflicts by writing bash scripts

solving cases: you said at check-in that you now trust me with the cases and that it's going well, 'go on'.

This way of monitoring will help us have a more complete picture of progress.

Also tomorrow when we have the check in if it is easy to do and define the soft skills better

Also, another thing I want to ask you at check in is the criteria that judge the RA and give me some advice on how I can achieve the best possible score.


**ELME**

There is no feedback for all areas in two weeks!! Tomorrow's check-in will probably be postponed since you were at CES and I will consult how the process is going in general because I have to submit the PAs anyway so I will talk to MMJ about it!! In any case, I want to tell you that working and solving cases is part of your responsibilities and that you do it does not necessarily mean that you excel at it, just as the fact that you distribute your tasks is expected by everyone and that you did it again does not mean that you excel at it! In any case, especially from your message above, I understand that you have probably assumed some things incorrectly and I think that I have clearly expressed my own point of view both in writing and orally!! So in any case, we will talk about everything again during the check-in!! I do not think it is right to analyze things via chat because something can be misinterpreted!!

**Message/inform mentorabout the situation**


**NIKOS - early description of the team dinamic - an situation - message date 19 august - 19/8/26**

Hello my mentor

Sorry for the late of the hour and excuse my grammar mistakes.

I think i have found a topic we can talk about at our upcoming Thursday meeting. I have a very good suspicion that im silently getting fired(I delayed around 7 days to tell you about that because i was researching the web of how to deal with the situation). But it might be just my idea.

1.The acquisitions: 
At my last TL check-in (august 12) one-to-one meeting, my TL ELME told me that the feedback about me from my colleges is negative, she also told me what exactly was the negative feedback, and provided guidance"(But if you ask me, in a way, I sensed something in the atmosphere that made me feel-or suspect that she might not want me on the team, or that she may have lost hope in me.)"

1.1 The feedback was that:
That i have trouble following STEPS. And that i'm not keeping effective notes resulting asking the same question many times.

1.1.1What she said:
"i have seen/hear things, that have made me concerned"
1.1.2When Happened:
its happen at (6/8/26 i was 2 months and 4 days in), i have the moment that this happened saved in my Teams conversations.
1.1.3.What Happened:
It was the second time i was enqunter a patcher. and the first time i was making a PATCHER by my own (without help of my buddy). after AGSF showed me how to do it once(and the whole process wasn't 100% clear to me up to this moment). I did a mistake and was blocked so i asked for her help again then she accused me: "you didn't kept down the steps i gave you last time, for now on you should keeping notes" after this accusation i replied with a screenshot showing her that i do kept notes but my quotes was not complete. What have happened was that i had skipped a Step of my notes. AGSF mistakenly sent a message that was to be sent to our TL, and immediately she deleted it. The message was saing: "i showed him how to do it but he did not do it by his own... i had to go back and show him again how to do it, ill will not do that again, he is not learning what im showing him so i feel im waisting my time to him"

1.2 The other feedback she gave to me:
'the correct use of the tools (AZURE, LINQpad, Toolkit) is expected at this point because, i either should know how to use them until now, either i should be more proficient/experienced beforehand"

1.2.1what she said(I blending her words with what i understanded):
"What i don't want is to be 6 months in and you are still unfamiliar with the tools this scenario will be bad, because i want to have in the teem someone i trust that ill know he can do the job if i hang it to him(make a release, solve some hard tasks, find the issue)."
AND
"You need to ask less questions of things you already know, you are asking too much help",
"You need to be more Independent, You are a consultant. Consultants solve problems-they don't create more! If you're not able to understand a problem and solve it, then it's no use. In our team, it's the consultants and the solutions they provide that put food on our tables."

1.2.2When it happened:
(07/21 1month and 18 days in)

1.2.3What happened that provoke her to feel this way:
While using azueDevOps To pullRequest, ELRI made a comment to my PR asking something, rhis action blocked the PR for prociding, but i did the mistake to 'resolve' her comments twice, because i didn't know how to answer them properly, i had seen AGSF to reject cortexe's comments this way so i thought that was the way to go, ELRI didn't explained why rejecting a comment is a not the right way so that why i rejected her comment for the second time, she finaly told me: "perimeneis ton reviewer to resolve the comment", as i found out she had reported to ELME that i was rejecting it and found out that this was some short of 'iligal' think to do(?). Nobody had told me it was the wrong way, later i found out that by commenting back to her i could unlock the AZURE and continue with the case solving flow. I just want to remind here that i have not worked with azuredevops or made a pr again to this point ever. 

1.3because of 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1 at dates (6/8/26) and (21/7/26) and maybe other reasons i dont know, ELME my TL decided to put me in a PIP.

1.3.1What she said:
"because i have see something that i want to check, for now on we will doing 2 checkins every month, and after each checkin ill making an email of what we talked about and ill sending it to the PM and TM to inform them for your development on goals we will set. Its not something you need to worry about this does not have distractive consiquenses for you , its something we do only thinking your development, i dont want you to get anxius or start working more than you do because of that condision im puting in"

conclusion of the above conv: ELME my TL, decided to put me in a plan with weekly meetings (2 meetings per month) to check if im getting better the upper goals (something that sounds like PIP(Performance Improvement Plant). She will have the goals ready until this Friday, and then she will send them to our Project Manager (Petter), and our team manager (MMJ) to approve the PIP and give her guidance. My web research showed me that this is the typical action when a company or a team want to fire you! My reaction was very positive allthought my thought was that: "that sounds nice i work very effectively when i have clear goal"

2.Atempt to defend myself
even though at the one-to-one i agreed with all the acquisitions, partly, because i am a aggregable person and saw the whole thing as a challenge that will make me more effective and experienced at the end(romanticising things), ill try now to say here why i believe its not my fault, and why i believe this situation is unfair.

I have those at my side:
2.1From moment one i was asking my TL to give me clear guidelines and feedbacks, her usual answer was that 'we will talk about those at our next check-ins, that's why check-ins are for, i don't have something to tell u now', but those meetings was so far apart.

2.2AGSF and especially ELRI (the colleges that made the acquisitions) where cold with me from the beginning. Now i feel that they are constantly looking for my slightest error to magnify it and saw it to my TL. At the time i made those 2 errors(the ones i have captured above) i was at the first month i was trying actively to do tasks alone, both of those 2 tasks was the fist task of that kind i was doing alone, and the flow of what to do was not 100% clear to me yet, and my approach was 'ask a lot of questions because you are new' and 'its ok to do some mistakes its expected'. Their reaction came out of the blue, i was not told that my 'learning period' was over until then ill contacting everyone to learn and get inspired of the way they were working! If i knew, i would be much more stoic with my questions, to not trigger situations like this.

2.3i had a check in with my Project teamManager MMJ and he told me 1"making questions is the most effective way to work, it becomes so easier and faster this way"(something like that), 2"The only way to learn is to make mistakes!!". So, its funny because my approach was to do exactly that (asking alot of questions), even though my gut feeling where telling me not too, and i get the bad consequences i was expected. Also him self is conscious of the of Greek teems,he said "we know that some times Greek TLs might get possessive" OR "the things at Greek teams are strange we are trying to address that, and put the teams to follow our Danish standards".  address that, and put the teams to follow our Danish standards" something like that. If you ask me, now that i have start seeing my team, i feel that the environment is Very competitive. And i dont feel discouraged about that dont get me wrong, what i feel is Thrill to fight back showing to everyone that i can be the best at this work. What scares me is that, i might already be set to fail from my collages sabotage, or that this whole PIP is the mechanism that the company has to get me fired.

2.4 I'II also list what happened at my first weeks on the company when my TL ELME & ELRI way trying to convince me that i said something i didn't, i had felt a little terrible about that, i felt like she didn't believing me and what my 

conclusion:

well i hope that i was honest to what i wrote, it might wouldn't its the first time i work in a corporate env of this Caliber, i dont know what to say or to feel. For sure if i feel something that is gratitude that i have tho opportunity to work here, i was trying to get hired from net company 2 years now, its the dream job for me. Also i want to say that i find things to admire to all my coworkers even the ones that trayed to (maybe) sabotage me. So at the end the only thing i want to say is Thanks for being able to be among you.

3.The rabbit hole

I don't know maybe the problem is just me... and i ok with that in this case, because as i have said from the start(day one), i am ready to follow all the guideline to get part of the team as long as i know them. But i have a crazy conspiracy theory of why i have end up to this situation that early. from the first moment i stepped in the team i felt that the team was already a closed clique... at the point that i was feeling awkward to eat with them. At the start i said to my self... "come one man don't be crazy its just your idea" but now more and more i see something like that, i have a feeling that the old ones AGSF and ELRI and sometimes rarely my buddy CHTAM don't wont me in the team and trying to sabotage me? At the point that they might gossiping behind our backs(actually i was present to some gossiping that happened)... that could be explain why they all got cold at the same time at some point.

I have a gutt feeling telling me that for now one they will wait for the slightest mistake ill made to report it.

but of course ill never get something like that TOO seriously, the above is not something ill use to defend my self, it would be childish... im just listing it just in case.

3.Questions

**Q** How would you advise me about the above?

**Q** Do you think that at this point i can do something about it, or the things are set to fail regardless? I have heard that when companies want to fire you its typical to put you in a PIP (like the one my TL want to put me into) just only to have clues of your bad performance to show to the HR. And also read that whatever you do, you will fail at the end and that is Staged.If you ask me what i will do? I have started working day and nigh now in order to surpass that with success. III not fall without a fight.

**Q** Is the above something that happens regular?

**Q** What am i doing now?


**MENTOR**

**after each checkin , i was sending the message  to my mentor, of what are the take aways from each meeting, **

Hey!

Im sharing here the take aways i have got until now from the TL check-ins, until resently i had only the 'Being Independent' now i just added the 'Figure Out' mindset, those are the things ill be giving attention to the upcoming weeks:  << IMAGE >>

**The third performance review, that was not talking about the progress i made at the previus areas ofactivity... **

**NIKOS- SEPT 26**

Hello Jesper

my TL send me her review for our last check-in, and its not good:

**ELME**
Hello Nikos,

Following our third performance review discussion, I'd like to document the key areas we covered during our meeting.

Areas of Focus:

Soft Skills Development & Project Management Tools:

During our conversation, we addressed the importance of developing stronger soft skills alongside better utilization of our project management tools. There have been several instances where the expected level of understanding wasn't demonstrated.

Specific Examples:

Toolkit Usage: Created cases for other teams within the toolkit system, when these should have been designated for our team specifically, despite having previously discussed the existence of relevant documentation.

Development Process: Shows

limited understanding of the pull request process, including how to properly push/fetch changes locally, and lacks familiarity with Azure DevOps (ADO)

Overall Assessment: While he tries to demonstrate and gain a solid business knowledge and performs well when objectives are clearly defined, there's a need to develop a more proactive mindset for professional growth in this role. The challenge is that clear direction won't always be available, there will be situations requiring independent problem solving and initiative. The toolkit example illustrates this point well. It's not practical for management to anticipate every potential issue and provide step-by-step guidance for each scenario. Developing strong proficiency with Netcompany's project management tools is essential for success, and this remains an area requiring significant improvement.

Next Steps: We'll continue to

monitor progress in these areas and provide support where needed while encouraging greater independence in problem-solving approaches.

I believe that in this review, the actions/improvements I made in the other improvement areas should be demonstrated as well; this way, my overall progress would be visible. I tried to reach out to her and tell her that, but I think that I explained it poorly. Her answer implied that I don't take her feedback effectively, so now I am sure that the next review will include that as a major red flag.

At our last meeting, you advised me to talk to her and ask her. "My mistakes are related to my understanding of how and why a tool works, but I'm not allowed to ask those questions. How can I learn how it works so as to not make mistakes?" But even more now, I feel that if I ask her, she will blame me for not taking feedback effectively.

I would like to ask for your advice and guidance on this situation.


**MENTOR**

have you tried to talk to MMJ? While she is right in that step by step guides can't always be available, you should be able to ask questions regarding the feedback to understand it more.

For example with the toolkit feedback, she shouldn't nessecarily be able to provide detailed guide as to what to do, but you should certainly be able to ask such questions as "In such case, if i'm in doubt moving forward, who should I reach out to?".

Have you talked to MMJ about this feeling of being unable to ask questions because you fear it will be read as you not taking feedback seriously?

ΟΚ, ακου τώρα την ιστορία μου:

Στις 3 ιουνίου 3/6/26 ήταν η πρώτη μερα στην δουλεια μου στην netcompany greece, μετά απο6 μήνες στις 19 δεκεμβρίου 19/12/26 με απέλισαν με την δικαιολογια της αναποτελεσματικότιτας/αποδοτικότιτας καταγκελοντας την επ αορίστου συμβαση μου. Τώρα θα σου περιγράψω την προεπιρεσία μου: αυτη ήταν η δευτερη μου δουλειά, πριν δουλευα σαν full stack σε μια εταιρία που το κυριο πρωιον της είναι ενα erp, δουλευαμε mssms και delphi, δεν είχαμε versioning, το versioning το καναμεμετονομάζοντας φακέλους με ήμερομινια και ώρα. Η δουλεια μου ήταν να πέρνω αναλύσεις απο την tl για τον κώδικα που πρέπει να γραψω, επίσης να κανω μορφοπιηση σε pdf , και ναα ακολουθώ documentation για να φτιάχνω/παραμετροποιω modules για το erp, οι διαδικασίες ήταν standard δεν χρειαζόταν σκεψη, επίσης η tl με είχε βαλει για διαστιμα 4ρων μηνών να κανω απλα copy paste διαφορα, γενικα δεν με θέλανε, γιαυτο και με απολυσανε, και γενικα δεν μου έδειναν δουλειά.

Τωρα θα περιγράψω το τι συνέβει στο διάστιμα απο την προσλιψη μου ως την απολιση στην νετκομπανι το οποιο είχε ως αποτελεσμα την απολυση μου: Τον πρώτο μήνα o buddy μου μου εδείχνε την χρήση κάθε εργαλείου θεωριτικά, και σταδιακα αρχιζα να αναλαμβάνω και εγω μόνοςμου δικά μου task απο την 3τη βδομάδα, ταυτοχρωνα εκανα πολλεςσημειώσεις αλλα οχι με τόσο αποτελεσματικό τροπο
